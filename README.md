# MCZ-pelletstove
Low cost connection to Home Assistant

With a ESP8266 connected to the MCZ remote control you can control the stove through Home Assistant.

Materials needed:

1x Esp8266 microcontroller (I used an bare esp12-e, but a D1 mini or Nodemcu will work too)
4X EL817 optocouplers
basic solder skill is needed to attach the wires to the RC main board.
